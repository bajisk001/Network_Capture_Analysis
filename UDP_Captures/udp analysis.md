# UDP Capture Analysis - ElevateLabs.org

## 1. Overview of UDP
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** is a core protocol that provides **connectionless** communication between applications on hosts across an IP network.  
- Unlike TCP, UDP does **not guarantee delivery, ordering, or error-checking**. Itâ€™s fast but unreliable â€” think of it like sending a letter without tracking.  

**Common applications that use UDP:**  
- DNS queries  
- Streaming (audio/video)  
- Online gaming  
- SNMP and other lightweight protocols  

### How UDP works (simplified)
1. Your computer wants to send data to **elevatelabs.org** or any server.  
2. UDP sends the data in **packets called datagrams** without establishing a connection.  
3. Each datagram is independent â€” the server may receive some, all, or none.  
4. If a reply is expected (e.g., DNS), the client waits for a response packet.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
- Capture live **UDP network packets** and identify UDP behaviour and related traffic types.  

- **Task:** Generate UDP traffic (e.g., ping, DNS queries, streaming test) and analyze it with Wireshark.  
- **Focus:** Observe UDP datagram delivery, ports, and payload, and note the lack of handshake or retransmissions.  

---

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- **Wireshark** (free, GUI-based packet capture tool)  
- **ping / dig / traceroute / browser** to generate UDP traffic  

**Example commands to generate UDP traffic:**
- ping -n 3 elevatelabs.org    # ICMP over IP (sometimes appears in UDP captures for related activity)

## ðŸ“‚ Deliverables

- **Packet capture file (.pcap):** `udp_capture.pcap` â€” contains UDP traffic.  
- **Short report:** Summarizes UDP behaviour, packet fields, and identified protocols.

## ðŸ§­ Steps to Capture Packets

### 1. Traffic Generation
1. Start Wireshark and begin capture on your active network interface.  
2. Generate UDP traffic using a terminal or browser. Examples:  
   - `dig elevatelabs.org`  
   - Ping commands, traceroutes, or streaming tests  
3. Let the capture run for ~30â€“60 seconds while performing actions, then stop capture.

### 2. Packet Capture Details

- **Tool used:** Wireshark  
- **Capture filter (optional):** `udp`  
- **Or specific port:** `udp port 53` (for DNS)  
- **Display filter (for analysis):** `udp`  

**Typical packets to look for:**  
- **Client â†’ Server:** UDP datagram sent  
- **Server â†’ Client:** UDP datagram reply (if applicable)  
- Each datagram is **independent**; no handshake exists

### 3. Important UDP Packet Fields (Explained Simply)

| Field / Item        | What it Means in Layman Terms |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Source Port**     | The port on the client machine (ephemeral/random high port). |
| **Destination Port**| The serverâ€™s service port (e.g., 53 for DNS). |
| **Length**          | Size of the UDP datagram payload. |
| **Checksum**        | Optional error-check to ensure packet integrity. |
| **Payload / Data**  | The actual data sent in the datagram (e.g., DNS query, game data). |

### 4. Protocol Recognition in Wireshark

- **Protocol column:** shows `UDP` or the application protocol (e.g., DNS, SNMP).  
- **Info column:** contains a short human-friendly summary, e.g.:  
  - `Standard query` (DNS request)  
  - `Standard query response` (DNS reply)  
- **Ports:** common UDP ports include 53 (DNS), 123 (NTP), 161 (SNMP)  

**Useful display filters:**  
- udp                    # show all UDP packets
- udp.port == 53          # show DNS traffic specifically

## 5. Communication Flow (Step-by-Step)

### UDP Communication
1. Client sends a **datagram** to the server (e.g., DNS query to port 53).  
2. Server responds with a **datagram reply** (e.g., resolved IP address).  
3. There is **no handshake**; each datagram is independent.  
4. If a packet is lost, UDP **does not retransmit**.  

### Example DNS Flow
- Client â†’ Server: *What is the IP of elevatelabs.org?*  
- Server â†’ Client: *The IP is 34.207.192.240* (example)  
- Both datagrams have **no sequence or acknowledgment numbers**.

## 6. Observations / Notes (What to look for in capture)
- **No handshake:** UDP is connectionless; no SYN/ACK like TCP.  
- **Datagram size:** Check length for payload size.  
- **Loss / retries:** UDP packets may be lost; Wireshark will not see automatic retransmissions.  
- **DNS behaviour:** Each DNS query generates a small request and reply.  
- **Multiple protocols:** In the same capture, you may also see DNS (UDP), ICMP (ping), HTTP (TCP) traffic.  

---

## âœ… Outcome
- Learned how to capture UDP packets with Wireshark.  
- Observed **connectionless communication** and datagram delivery.  
- Identified UDP-specific fields (length, ports, payload).  
- Recognized related protocols in a live capture (DNS, ICMP, TCP/HTTP).

## ðŸ“Ž File Included
- `udp_capture.pcap` â€” contains UDP traffic generated by browsing or querying **elevatelabs.org**.

## ðŸ’¡ Quick Wireshark Tips (for beginners)
- Start capture on the interface with your internet connection (Wi-Fi/Ethernet).  
- Use **Display Filter** `udp` to focus on UDP packets.  
- For DNS traffic specifically: `udp.port == 53`  
- Right-click a packet â†’ **Follow â†’ UDP Stream** to view the full conversation.  
- Check packet **Length** and **Checksum** to understand payload and integrity.
