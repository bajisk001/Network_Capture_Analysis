# DNS Capture Analysis
## 1. Overview of DNS

- DNS (Domain Name System) is like the phonebook of the internet.
- When you type a website name like tryhackme.com in your browser, your computer doesn’t understand names — it needs an IP address (like 104.26.2.109) to connect.
- DNS translates the human-friendly name into the machine-friendly IP address.
- Without DNS, we’d have to remember long numbers instead of website names.

## How DNS works (simplified):
- You type a domain (tryhackme.com) into the browser.
- Your computer sends a DNS query to a DNS server.
- The server replies with the IP address of that domain.
- Your browser then connects to the website using that IP.

## 🎯 Objective
- Capture live network packets and identify basic protocols and traffic types.

- **Task:** Generate DNS traffic and analyze it with Wireshark.  
- **Focus:** Observe how a DNS query (domain name → IP address) works.  

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Wireshark** (free, GUI-based packet capture tool).  
- **ping / browser** for generating network traffic.

## 📂 Deliverables
1. A **packet capture file (.pcap)** containing DNS traffic.  
2. A **short report** summarizing identified protocols and packet details.

## 🧭 Steps to Capture Packets

### 1. Traffic Generation
- Command used to generate DNS query Ex:ping picoctf.org


### 2. Packet Capture Details

Tool used: Wireshark.

Capture filter (optional):

udp port 53


Display filter (for analysis):

dns


Typical capture will show:

DNS Query (Client → Server).

DNS Response (Server → Client).

Usually, 2–4 packets are generated per query.

### 3. Wireshark Packet Fields (Explained Simply)
Field	What it Means in Layman Terms
Transaction ID	A unique number linking query ↔ response (like a token number).
Flags	Indicates if it’s a query/response, recursion request, etc.
Questions	Number of questions asked (e.g., “What is the IP of picoctf.org?”).
Answer RRs	Number of answers (IP addresses in the reply).
Queries	Domain name requested.
Answers	IP addresses returned by the DNS server.

### 4. Protocol Recognition

In Wireshark, DNS packets are easy to identify:

Protocol column: shows DNS.

Info column:

Standard query → request.

Standard query response → reply.

Port numbers: UDP 53 (sometimes TCP 53 if data >512 bytes).

### 5. Communication Flow

DNS over UDP is connectionless (no handshake like TCP).

Flow:

Client sends query: “What is the IP of picoctf.org?”

DNS server replies: “The IP is 34.207.192.240” (example).

Both packets share the same Transaction ID.

### 6. Observations / Notes

DNS is fast: one query, one response.

If DNS response >512 bytes, TCP (port 53) is used.

Captured traffic helps identify:

The domain queried.

The resolved IP address.

Whether resolution was successful.

🌐 Extra Protocols to Capture

Besides DNS, generate additional traffic (browse a website / ping a server).
Filter in Wireshark and identify at least 3 different protocols, for example:

DNS → Resolving domain names.

HTTP/HTTPS → Website browsing.

TCP/ICMP → Connection setup or ping traffic.

✅ Outcome

Learned how to capture packets with Wireshark.

Understood the role of DNS in translating domain names to IPs.

Identified multiple network protocols (DNS, HTTP/HTTPS, TCP/ICMP).

📎 File included:

dns_capture.pcap — contains DNS query/response packets
