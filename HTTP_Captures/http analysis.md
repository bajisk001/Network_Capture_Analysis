# HTTP Capture Analysis

## 1. Overview of HTTP
- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)** is an application layer protocol used for transmitting web content (HTML, images, videos, etc.) over the Internet.
- HTTP is **request-response based**: a client sends a request, and the server responds with content.
- HTTP typically runs over **TCP port 80**, while HTTPS runs over **TCP port 443** with TLS/SSL encryption.

**Common applications that use HTTP:**  
- Web browsing (HTML pages, images, API calls)  
- RESTful APIs  
- File downloads  

### How HTTP works (simplified)
1. Your browser or client requests a webpage or resource from a server.
2. The client sends an **HTTP request** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) over TCP.
3. The server processes the request and sends an **HTTP response** (status code + data).
4. The client renders or processes the response.
5. The underlying TCP connection may persist (keep-alive) or close after completion.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
- Capture live **HTTP network packets**.
- Generate HTTP traffic using a browser, curl, or HTTP client.
- Focus: Observe request/response flow, headers, methods, and payload.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- **Wireshark** (GUI-based packet capture tool)  
- **Browser / curl / Postman** to generate HTTP traffic  

---

## ðŸ“‚ Deliverables
- **Packet capture file (.pcap):** `http_capture.pcap` â€” contains HTTP traffic.
- **Short report:** Summarizes HTTP request/response behavior, headers, and common methods.

---

## ðŸ§­ Steps to Capture Packets

### 1. Traffic Generation
1. Start Wireshark and begin capture on your active network interface.
2. Generate HTTP traffic using a browser or terminal.
3. Browse websites using HTTP (non-HTTPS) links for visible traffic.
4. Let the capture run for ~30â€“60 seconds, then stop capture.

### 2. Packet Capture Details

-   **Tool used:** Wireshark
-   **Capture filter (optional):** `tcp port 80`
-   **Display filter (for analysis):** `http`

**Typical packets to look for:**

-   HTTP Request: Client â†’ Server (GET, POST, etc.)
-   HTTP Response: Server â†’ Client (200 OK, 404 Not Found, etc.)
-   Headers and Payload: Check request/response headers and body

### 3. Important HTTP Packet Fields

| Field / Item     | What it Means in Layman Terms                                           |
| :--------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Request Method** | Type of request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD)                          |
| **Request URI**    | Resource requested by client (e.g., `/index.html`)                      |
| **Status Code**    | Response status (200 OK, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error)      |
| **Headers**        | Metadata about request/response (Content-Type, Host, User-Agent, etc.)  |
| **Payload / Body** | Actual data sent (HTML, JSON, images)                                   |
| **Host**           | Server hostname (e.g., example.com)                                     |
| **Content-Length** | Size of the response body in bytes                                      |

### 4. Protocol Recognition in Wireshark

-   **Protocol column:** Shows `HTTP` if Wireshark decodes application layer.
-   **Info column:** Human-friendly summary of HTTP messages, e.g.:
    -   `GET /index.html HTTP/1.1`
    -   `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`
-   **Useful Display Filters:**
    ```
    http              # Show all HTTP packets
    http.request      # Show only HTTP requests
    http.response     # Show only HTTP responses
    tcp.port == 80    # Filter TCP port 80 traffic (HTTP)
    ```

---

### 5. Communication Flow (Step-by-Step)

**HTTP Request/Response Flow**

-   Client sends HTTP request: e.g., `GET /index.html HTTP/1.1`
-   Server sends HTTP response: e.g., `HTTP/1.1 200 OK + HTML payload`
-   Headers exchanged: Metadata about connection, content type, length, etc.
-   Data transfer: The payload (HTML, JSON, images) is delivered to client
-   Connection closure: TCP may close or remain open if keep-alive is used

**Example Flow:**

-   Client â†’ Server: `GET /index.html HTTP/1.1`
-   Server â†’ Client: `HTTP/1.1 200 OK + HTML content`

---

### 6. Observations / Notes

-   HTTP traffic is clear text; you can see headers and body in Wireshark.
-   Observe common methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
-   Check response codes: 200, 301, 404, 500, etc.
-   Watch TCP segmentation if payload is large.
-   Multiple protocols may appear in the same capture: TCP, DNS, ICMP.

---

### âœ… Outcome

-   Learned how to capture HTTP packets with Wireshark.
-   Observed request/response flow and headers.
-   Identified HTTP-specific fields and common status codes.
-   Recognized related protocols in a live capture (TCP, DNS, ICMP).

---

### ðŸ“Ž File Included

-   `http.pcap` â€” contains HTTP traffic generated by browsing or curl requests.

---

### ðŸ’¡ Quick Wireshark Tips

-   Start capture on the interface with your internet connection (Wi-Fi/Ethernet).
-   Use Display Filter `http` to focus on HTTP packets.
-   For requests only: `http.request`
-   For responses only: `http.response`
-   Right-click a packet â†’ Follow â†’ TCP Stream to view full conversation.
-   Inspect headers and payload to understand request/response behavior.
